          Each year, heavy monsoon rains threaten millions of lives across South
          Asia. This year’s monsoon season is getting worse by the day, causing
          widespread damage across Bangladesh. Communities have lost their
          homes, livelihoods and lack access to essential food, water, and basic
          medical assistance.

          Being trapped and surrounded by deep floodwater means people are
          unable to access basic essentials, and the little supplies they do
          have are quickly running out. The strong winds and heavy rain continue
          to put lives and property at risk. Entire livelihoods, cattle and
          farmland are destroyed, leaving people with absolutely nothing. Please
          help us help them, today.

              Shelter means protection during period of crisis. The people of
              Bangladesh, a country prone to natural disasters, are familiar
              with the ‘Cyclone Shelter’. But the concept of flood shelter is
              relatively new. Traditionally, embankments are most commonly used
              as shelters during floods.

              Children and adults need to be role models when it comes to
              heeding weather warnings and warnings. Children must be taught
              about the dangers of flooding, what to do and what not to do, and
              how to best keep themselves safe. It should be explained in a
              manner designed to educate and not simply frighten.
